Labyrinth or maze generator comparing two different algorithms.

## Information
Study program: TKT

Project language: Python and English

The two algorithms used are possibly Prim's algorithm, Wilson's algorithm, recursive division method and/or Aldous-Broder algorithm.
This program is meant to show the differences between maze generating algorithms.

The program will receive input from the user concerning the size of the maze and the algorithm used to generate it.
