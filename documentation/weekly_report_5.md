# Weekly report 5

Time spent: 11 hours

## Development this week

- Finished coding the Aldous-Broder algorithm
- Cleaned up code
- Documented all of the code
- Implemented a stopwatch for the Aldous-Broder algorithm
- Made new tests for the Aldous-Broder algorithm

## Problems

After a small break I read the old instructions of the Aldous-Broder algorithm and the way to implement it just clicked for me and I was able to code it with fairly little trouble.

## Next week

Implementing a route finding algorithm to test the mazes further and writing more documentation.
