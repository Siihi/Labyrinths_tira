# Weekly report 3

Time spent: 15 hours

## Development this week

- Finished coding randomized Prim's algorithm
- Wrote tests for prim.py
- Setup pylint for code quality
- Research on Aldous-Broder algorithm

## Problems

Prim's algorithm was surprisingly difficult to code for me and small coding errors (e.g. i = 1 instead of i += 1) hindered my process substantially.
Writing the tests was also difficult in the beginning, but I cut up the program into functions, making the testing easier.

## Next week

Starting to code the Aldous-Broder algorithm and continuing with testing, as well as implementing a stopwatch to measure the time it takes to generate a maze.
