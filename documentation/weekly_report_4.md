# Weekly report 4

Time spent: 10 hours

## Development this week

- Started coding the Aldous-Broder algorithm
- Made an implementation document
- Cleaned up code
- Implemented a stopwatch for randomized Prim's algorithm

## Problems

I am having a surprisingly hard time coding the Aldous-Broder algorithm. I haven't been able to find written instructions as good as the ones for randomized Prim's algorithm, which I think is my main problem. I can't really wrap my head around how to implement the walls the same way as in randomized Prim's algorithm.

## Next week

Finding better instructions for the Aldous-Broder algorithm and continuing to implement it. Writing more tests and possibly comparing the two algorithms.
