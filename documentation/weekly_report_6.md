# Weekly report 6

Time spent: 5 hours

## Development this week

- Updated testing and implementation documentation
- Made a time comparison graph with data from the program
- Researched how to implement a maze solving algorithm to test the mazes with

## Problems

Being sick has hindered my ability to do any coding work so unfortunately the coding of a maze solver has to be pushed back to next week.

## Next week

Implementing a maze solving algorithm to help test the mazes and updating the testing document to include it.
