# Project specification

This project aims to compare two different maze or labyrinth generation algorithms.

### Algorithms

The algorithms used are randomized Prim's algorithm and Aldous-Broder algorithm.
This program is meant to show the differences between maze generating algorithms.

### Input

The program will receive input from the user concerning the size of the maze and the algorithm used to generate it.

### Sources
