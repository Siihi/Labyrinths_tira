# Weekly report 2

Time spent: 12 hours

## Development this week

- Started coding randomized Prim's algorithm
- Made a simple visual execution of the maze
- Made a simple interface for users
- Started testing, maze.py fully tested
- GitHub Actions and codecov setup (badges visible in README)

## Problems

Prim's algorithm is harder to code from scratch than I thought. Maybe finding better instructions than the wikipedia article will help me further.

## Next week

Deciding the second algorithm to use and finishing coding Prim's algorithm, along with continuing with writing tests.
